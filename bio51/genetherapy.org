Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic condition that damages the membrane (myelin sheath) that covers nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. When this insolating layer is damaged, nerve signals from the brain cannot communicate across the body properly, causing impaired bodily functions or paralysis. ALD prevents the body from breaking down very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), causing these fatty acid chains to build up in the brain, nervous system and adrenal gland. The accumulation is thought to cause inflammation in the body, damaging the myelin sheath. ALD is a genetic condition that may be inherited from one or both parents. ALD most severely affects males when it can either present during childhood or during adulthood. Women who are carriers for ALD develop a milder form of the disease during adulthood. Symptoms are loss of vision, learning disabilities, dysphagia, difficulty swallowing etc.,

Gene therapy can be used to halt the progression of ALD. Researchers used a lentivirus to infuse a normal copy of the ABCD1 gene into the bone marrow of boys with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), and the corrected protein stopped disease progression. This is the first successful gene therapy treatment to halt a fatal brain disease. Gene therapy for ALD is in phase I/II of clinical trials. I was not able to find the cost of gene therapy for ALD but based on cost estimates for other similar gene therapy solutions, it is estimated in the millions. It certainly cannot reach everyone in need of the therapy.
