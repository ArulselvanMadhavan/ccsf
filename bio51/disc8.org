Testis has the largest gene expression in the human body. Gene
expression in these cells account for 84%(15,518) of the genes are
expressed here. 24 genes are predominantly expressed in testis. Most
of them are spermatocytes and spermatids. Testis is the human organ
that contains sperm cells. There are genes that are expressed higher
in sperms, and there are genes that are only expressed in sperm cells.
DMRT1 - a transcription factor primarily expressed in the nuclei of
spermatogonia, which plays a key role in male sex determination and
differentiation by controlling testis development and male germ cell
proliferation.  PASD1 is a cancer-associated antigen and a nuclear
suppressor of the biological clock. Another example of a
cancer-associated antigen is SAGE1. The gene MAGEC1 encodes a member
of the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family.

One example of a gene expressed in Sertoli cells is SLCO6A1, currently
with evidence only at transcript level. The INSL3 gene, specifically
expressed in Leydig cells, is suggested to be involved in the
development of the urogenital tract and involved in intra-abdominal
testicular descent.
