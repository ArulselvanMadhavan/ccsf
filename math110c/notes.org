* 2D Vectors
  - magnitude + direction
  - rep by arrows, x, y components
  - unit vector: v^ = v/|v|
  - circle with radius = 1
  - initial and terminal points
  - all start at origin
    - they don't have to start to origin
* Vector addition
  - a + b forms the diagonal of a parallelogram
  - IP: IP of a -> TP of copy of b
  - a - b forms the other diagonal of the same parallelogram
  - IP: terminal point of b -> terminal point of a
  - b - a = - (a - b)
* Dot product
  - a . b = 0 => a and b are perpendicular
  - theta = arccos((a.b)/|a||b|)
  - proj_a(b) = ka
  - k = (b.a/(a.a))
* 3D equations and their graphs
  - y = z
    - (0,1,1)
  - x = z
  - y = x
