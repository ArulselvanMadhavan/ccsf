I have learned a little bit about Darwin's theory of evolution. The
importance of natural selection, and how every organism on earth came
about by means of mutations, and still share similarities at a
cellular level. For example, the mitochondrian in human cells used to
be bacteria that got subsumed by an eukaryote. It's a fascinating
topic and I haven't learned it properly. I would like to learn more
about horizontal gene transfer, the theory behind how different
biological adaptations came about.
